A cross-platform open-source extendable chatGPT-like app with a GUI.

![sample image](assets/sample_conversation.png)

It's using the Antropic's Claude API (but one can easily replace it with another LLM).

# Why?

## Advantages over proprietary apps by Claude, OpenAI, etc
- open-source. You can see exactly what it does and how it works
- no telemetry
- cross-platform. No need to wait for an app for your OS
- modifiable. Add your plugins, change it to your specific use case, replace the AI provider etc.
- you can specify a large custom context that will be applied to all sessions (e.g. the documentation of your project)

## Disadvantages
- the user experience may be not as polished as proprietary apps (we are not a big corp with infinite resources).
